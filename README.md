# 23 spring Deep Learning
# Final project


tuple_extract.ipynb contains code that extract image tuple from video.

tupledata.py and clipdata.py are implement of pytorch dataset for image tuple classification task and clip ordering task respectively.

Net.py and ViT_var.py contains definition of our model.

show_model.py are used to check the architecture of the model.

train.py and train_vit.py are training process for the two tasks.

pair_wise_inference.py are used to evaluate our models.
